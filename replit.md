# Expert Support Matching Platform

## Overview

The Expert Support Matching Platform is a comprehensive web-based survey application designed to connect entrepreneurs with expert support for business growth. The platform has been transformed from an employer diagnostic tool to an entrepreneur assessment system that captures business challenges and matches users with appropriate expert guidance. Built with vanilla JavaScript and Firebase backend services, it provides a streamlined assessment experience focusing on business growth needs, expert support matching, and commitment evaluation.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
The platform is built as a Single Page Application (SPA) using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, employing a component-based structure for modularity. It features a responsive design using CSS variables and modern styling, with progressive enhancement ensuring basic functionality even without JavaScript. Key UI/UX decisions include an iOS-style liquid glass navigation bar, subtle glassmorphism effects across the interface, premium button designs, and a sophisticated animated gradient background. Typography uses the Inter font, and partner logos are scaled for visual hierarchy. The application provides a user-friendly 5-step interactive tutorial with glassmorphism modals and supports bilingual content (English and Kinyarwanda). The form structure is streamlined into four sections for improved user experience, and a dynamic multi-position system allows efficient data entry.

### Backend Architecture
Firebase serves as the Backend-as-a-Service, utilizing Firestore for real-time data storage of surveys, responses, and user data. Firebase Authentication handles admin user management, eliminating the need for a custom backend server.
